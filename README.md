# Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System

## Description

The **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System** is a modular solution designed for small to medium-sized businesses to manage their operations efficiently. This system helps businesses track and manage their **inventory**, **sales**, and **financial records**, providing a unified platform for operational control. Built using **React.js** for the frontend and incorporating **state management**, **form validation**, and **data visualization**, the system is easy to extend and scale.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Displays key business metrics, including inventory levels, sales figures, and financial data.
- **Inventory Management**: Allows users to manage and update product inventory, track supplier information, and monitor stock levels.
- **Sales Management**: Provides tools for managing customer orders, tracking sales, and viewing sales performance.
- **Financial Management**: Handles financial transactions, expense tracking, and reconciliation of financial records.
- **Reconciliation Portal**: Helps users reconcile discrepancies between inventory and financial data.
- **Authentication**: Secure user login and registration functionality.
- **Form Validation**: Uses Formik and Yup for handling and validating forms, ensuring data consistency.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays financial trends and business metrics using Chart.js.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (>= 12.x)
- NPM (comes with Node.js)
- React.js (>= 17.x)

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/erp-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

This `README.md` file provides a detailed overview of the **ERP System**, its features, installation instructions, and how to use the system. It also outlines potential future enhancements to the system. Let me know if you need any additional sections or changes!
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
